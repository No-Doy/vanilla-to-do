## Vanilla To Do List
### By using only html, css, and vanilla JavaScript I programmed a To Do list. A user can add items to the list and check them off as they complete tasks. The user can delete the items individually or remove all items from the list by using the "clear all" button.
### I used Visual Studio's extention "Live Server" to host it locally
